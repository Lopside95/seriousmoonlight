      <p>
        We’re a collection of brand strategy and content specialists who work
        together to tell compelling stories. Peter Wallington has been inspired
        by David Bowie’s music since, well, a long time ago. He has been a
        journalist, co-founded a PR firm called DiagonalStreet Communications
        and sold it to Ogilvy South Africa after a while, and during that time
        worked on financial and corporate communication campaigns. Serious
        Moonlight has focused on logistics, tourism and education, and Peter
        works with talented designers, writers, media and business strategists
        and social media operators.
